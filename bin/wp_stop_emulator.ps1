# Tells Hyper-V to set the state to stopped. This script by itself cannot kill
# a running Windows Phone emulator. It doesn't have the permissions to do so.
# You should use "taskkill" to kill the "xde.exe" process which will cause the
# emulator to close, but Hyper-V won't register that the emulator is stopped.
# Run this script to let Hyper-V know you just killed the emulator.
